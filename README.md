ChronoSaga
Welcome to the repository of ChronoSaga. This project aims to offer players an experience akin to reading an interactive book, where every decision has the potential to alter the course of the story.

Current State
As of now, the project consists of:

Character Generator: Allows players to create a unique character by specifying their name, race, gender, and other traits. Aspects like strength, dexterity, intelligence, and charisma are randomly generated.

Year Adder: The game provides a mechanism to advance the character's age. This is a placeholder for more intricate time-based mechanics we plan to integrate in the future.

Responsive Design: The game is playable on both web browsers and mobile devices, though optimizations are ongoing for the mobile interface.

Future Vision
Interactive Storytelling: Just like flipping the pages of a book, players will venture into quests, face moral dilemmas, and make critical decisions that influence the outcome of the story.

Forming Parties: Players can recruit NPCs to join their cause, each bringing unique skills and stories to the table.

Quests & Adventures: Players will embark on various quests, from simple fetch quests to intricate political intrigues. Each quest will be a chapter, adding depth to the game's world and lore.

Choice-Based Consequences: Every decision made by the player will have repercussions. From the alliances they form to the battles they choose, the game world will react dynamically.

Skills & Abilities: As characters progress, they'll acquire new skills and abilities that will aid them in their adventures, allowing for a more varied gameplay experience.
