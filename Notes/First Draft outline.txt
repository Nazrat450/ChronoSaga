Step 1: Define Game Mechanics and Rules
Define possible races, classes, skills, jobs, and quests.
Decide on the character attributes: age, skills, race, and health.
Design the rules for leveling up, earning money, marrying, having children, and going on quests.
Step 2: Set Up the React Project
Initialize a new React project.
Install any additional dependencies you'll need.
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app dnd-fantasy-game
cd dnd-fantasy-game
Save to grepper
Step 3: Create State Management
Create states for the character's attributes, game settings, and so on.
You may use Context API or Redux for global state management.
jsx
Copy code
const [character, setCharacter] = useState({
  age: 0,
  skills: {},
  race: '',
  health: 100,
  // ...
});
Save to grepper
Step 4: Create Components
CharacterCreation: for selecting race, initial skills, etc.
PlanningMenu: for choosing options for the year.
Outcome: to show the results after the "age" button is clicked.
Events: for pop-up events that occur during the year, offering choices to the player.
Step 5: Implement Game Logic
Create functions for aging, job selection, marriage, skill learning, and so on.
jsx
Copy code
const ageCharacter = () => {
  // Update character age, possibly health and other attributes.
}

const findJob = () => {
  // Find a job based on character's skills and age.
}

const goOnQuest = () => {
  // Randomly generate a quest, resolve it based on character's skills, dice roll, etc.
}
Save to grepper
Step 6: Implement Event and Choice Mechanism
Create a function to generate random events based on the character's attributes.
Implement dice roll logic to determine the success or failure of actions.
jsx
Copy code
const rollDice = (sides) => {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
}

const resolveEvent = (event) => {
  // Use dice roll and character attributes to resolve the event.
}
Save to grepper
Step 7: Implement UI
Create a pleasant user interface for better gameplay experience.
Step 8: Testing
Test all functionalities to make sure the game runs smoothly.
Step 9: Deployment
Deploy the game online once it is polished and bug-free.
This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation can get quite complex. But it should give you a good starting point! Good luck with your game development.

}
Save to grepper
Validity Checks: Ensure the options selected are valid together. For example, you can’t go on a quest and work a full-time job at the same time.
jsx
Copy code
const validatePlan = () => {
  if (yearPlan.job && yearPlan.quest) {
    // Show an error or force the player to choose.
  }
}
Save to grepper
